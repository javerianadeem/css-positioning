            The proverb has deep meaning, which is always useful for a successful life. It conveys the idea that we should always think and then act accordingly. Impulsive actions may lead us to embarrassing and odd situations. As we should always think before we speak, in the same way we should think before we act. Life is full of various factors, the factors which can fascinate us for the moment but may lead us to failure or the factors which can repel immediately but may be the stepping stones to success. For example, going to a movie or playing video games may seem an attractive thing for the time being but can, in the course of time not only disturb one’s studies but also injure our eyes. Therefore, we should always restrain our intuitive and impulsive desires and then act according to what our mind says is right. Even the great men like Gandhi. Nehru, John Kennedy have been prey to their passions and emotions due to which the nations suffered. We should learn from their lives and should always act thoughtfully.

When she sat down to dinner at a round table covered with a three-day-old cloth opposite her husband who, lifting the lid off the soup, shouted excitedly, "Ah! Beef stew! What could be better," she dreamed of fine dinners, of shining silverware, of tapestries which peopled the walls with figures from another time and strange birds in fairy forests; she dreamed of delicious dishes served on wonderful plates, of whispered gallantries listened to with an inscrutable smile as one ate the pink flesh of a trout or the wings of a quail.
                She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which some one was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves.

        A place that I enjoy going to is the beach.. It is seen as a place of relaxation because it is normally quiet and peaceful there. To look around you and see the beauty of mother nature at it's finest. The majority of people you ask will say that it is one of their favorite vacation destinations. Not only for the beauty and relaxation but for the sheer entertainment. That is the three reasons I enjoy it as much as I do.</p>
    <p class="pp">
        I go to the beach to get away from all my troubles that are bothering me. To feel the grainy sand all under your toes. To sit there under the sun feeling the warmth of it beating down on your skin. To know that if you get too hot that you only have to walk about ten feet down until you get into the brisk cool ocean, and feel instant relief from the blistering sun. Also to lay on a float in the ocean and just feel the ocean as you are a part of it. Not only to feel but to hear the waves is the ultimate relaxation.

            A tree is a large woody plant. A defining feature is its tall hard stem. They have leaves. They propagate using seeds. There are a group of trees in a forest.

            Trees are beautiful and useful gifts of nature. Trees are great friends of men. Trees give us flowers, fruits, timber, bamboo, fuels, etc. We can rest under the cool shade of a tree. We get wood from the trees to make furniture, doors, windows, etc.

    <p class="pp">
            Trees
            release oxygen  which we need for our
            life. They also absorb the carbon -dioxide. Trees are the natural habitat
            of many animals and birds. Trees help make the land fertile. We get good crops
            out of fertile land. They are the sources of the fruits and flowers. They offer
            us cool shade during summer. During rainy season, we take shelter under the
            trees. Trees and plants are the sources of many supply life-saving drugs. They
            prevent land erosion and guard us against pollution. Thus, trees keep up the
            ecological balance. Trees protect us from inclement wind also. Thus, trees play an important role in our life.

                    She did not hear the story as many women have heard the same, with a paralyzed inability to accept its significance. She wept at once, with sudden, wild abandonment, in her sister's arms. When the storm of grief had spent itself she went away to her room alone. She would have no one follow her.

                    There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.
